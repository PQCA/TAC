5. Technical Advisory Council

    a) The role of the TAC is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the Technical Projects. The TAC will be responsible for:
    + i) coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an overall technical vision for the community;
    + ii) making recommendations to the Governing Board of priorities for Technical Projects resourcing;
    + iii) electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings, ensure meeting minutes are taken and who will also serve on the Governing Board as the TAC’s representative (the “TAC Representative”);
    + iv) creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes, subject to the approval of the Governing Board; and
    + v) such other matters related to the technical role of the TAC as may be communicated to the TAC by the Governing Board.

    b) The voting members of the TAC consist of:
    + i) One representative appointed by each Premier Member, for a term of one year, up to a maximum of seven total Premier Member representatives. If there are more than seven Premier Members at the start of a calendar year, the Governing Board shall approve an election process for seven Premier Member representatives.
    + ii) One representative selected by the TAC from academic or research nominees proposed by the Associate Members or TAC Representatives.
    + iii) One representative appointed by the technical oversight body (e.g., a technical steering committee) of each Technical Project selected for TAC membership as defined in (1) and (2) below (each such project, a “TAC Project”), for a term of one year, up to a maximum of seven total TAC Project representatives. If there are more than seven TAC Projects, the TAC shall approve an election process.
      + (1) For the first two years, Technical Projects eligible for TAC Project status will consist of:
        + (a) any Technical Projects identified as eligible at the onset of the Directed Fund;
        + (b) any Technical projects at a project lifecycle phase identified as eligible for TAC voting membership; and
        + (c) any Technical Projects identified as eligible by the TAC with a 2/3 vote.

      + (2) After 2 years, projects eligible for TAC Project status will consist of any projects at a project lifecycle phase identified as eligible for TAC voting membership.

    c) Objective qualifications for TAC member nominations may be set by the TAC and approved by the GB.

    d) The TAC will hold open technical meetings.

    e) No single Member, company, or set of Related Companies will be entitled to appoint or nominate more than two representatives for the TAC.

    f) The TAC representatives will elect a chair to preside over meetings, ensure minutes are taken and drive the TAC agenda with input from the TAC representatives.

6. Voting

    a) Quorum for Governing Board and Committee meetings will require at least fifty percent of the voting representatives. If advance notice of the meeting has been given per normal means and timing, the Governing Board may continue to meet even if quorum is not met, but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

    b) Ideally decisions will be made based on consensus. If, however, any decision requires a vote to move forward, the representatives of the Governing Board or Committee, as applicable, will vote on a one vote per voting representative basis.

    c) Except as provided in Section 16.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote at a meeting will require a simple majority vote, provided quorum is met. Except as provided in Section 16.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by electronic vote without a meeting will require a majority of all voting representatives.

    d) In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be resolved by the Governing Board, the Chair may refer the matter to the LF for assistance in reaching a decision. If there is a tied vote in any Committee that cannot be resolved, the matter may be referred to the Governing Board.
